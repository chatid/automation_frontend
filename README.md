### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * Or Install Node.js with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install node
    ```
2. Sauce Credentials
    * In the terminal export your Sauce Labs Credentials as environmental variables:
    ```
    $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
	$ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```
3. Project Dependencies
	* Install Node modules
	```
	$ npm install
	```

### Running Tests

* Tests in Parallel:
	```
	$ ./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -e chrome,firefox,internet_explorer_10,android_s4_emulator,iphone_6_simulator tests
	```

### Advice/Troubleshooting

1. There may be additional latency when using a remote webdriver to run tests on Sauce Labs. Timeouts or Waits may need to be increased.

### Resources
##### [Sauce Labs Documentation](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/)

##### [SeleniumHQ Documentation](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/)

##### [NightwatchJS Documentation](http://nightwatchjs.org/api)

##### [Node Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)

##### [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* A great resource to search for issues not explicitly covered by documentation

### Reports

1. Reports are automatically run when tests are fired off. By default they are stored in /root/reports.

2. They are in XML format to be readily ingested into whatever reporting platform is used.

3. These reports are optional if going through a third party service such as [Sauce Labs](https://www.saucelabs.com) or [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com).

### Work Completed

1. Starting a new chat

2. Ending a new chat

3. Verifying the CTA renders

4. Minimizing the Welcome Bar

5. Open a minimized Welcome Bar

6. Navigate to the Welcome homepage

7. Opening Welcome Bar

### To Do

Plenty, but going through [TestRail](https://welcomecommerce.testrail.com) will provide insights into what to automate next. Dre has login credentials. Remember that additional credentials cost additional money (we're on a per user license instead of a site license).

### Page Objects

Think of a page object as writing a test in OO form. Consider each "page" to be its own object. While this method is typically used for large websites (login page, product page, user page, etc...), it can be applied here as well.

Pages are stored in /root/pages. Within the page object file you can write out the actions for Selenium/Nightwatch to execute.

### Writing Tests

While this may seem like a trivial task on the surface, it is a fair bit harder than one might expect.

#### Locators
CSS - These are to be considered the gold standard. Use them if at all possible. In Nightwatch you can invoke searching by CSS as follows:
```
client.useCss()
```
After that, it's simply a matter of invoking the appropriate method within Nightwatch (click, assert, etc...).

XPath - If CSS locators are failing, try using XPath instead. It's essentially a direct path to the object you're looking for. To invoke XPath in Nightwatch:
```
client.useXpath()
```
Then paste in the XPath locator.

To find the correct CSS or XPath locator, use Chrome Inspector. If you right click on a piece of code and select copy, you will see options to copy the selector (CSS) or XPath.

#### Additional Notes
The above is a good place to start, but a middle layer is required to make the automation more extensible. The loactors will not be the same from website to website. While you could certainly write individual tests on a per retailer basis, I suggest the following format instead (pseudocode being used here, proceed with caution).

Map the CSS locators to a generic locator class.

Ex: newegg_CTA -> generic_CTA

Then you can make calls to the generic class and only have to make changes to which retailer/website is being tested.
